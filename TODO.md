# Medishop Image Rendering Fix

## Current Task: Fix images not rendering in Shop page

### Steps:

- [x] Analyze issue: Invalid image sources in dummyData.js causing non-rendering.
- [ ] Update dummyData.js: Replace images with valid placeholder URLs (picsum.photos) for all 8 products.
- [ ] Test: Launch browser on /shop, verify all images render with variety.
- [ ] Confirm: Check responsive view and interactions (e.g., Add button).
- [ ] Complete: Attempt completion with demo command.

### Notes:

- Backend/frontend servers are running.
- No backend changes needed; dummy data is frontend-only.
