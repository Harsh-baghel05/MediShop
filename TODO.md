# TODO: Fix Image Rendering Issue

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Check CSS styles for images in medishop-frontend/src/css/styles.css to ensure images are visible and properly sized
- [x] Add fallback image handling in medishop-frontend/src/components/ProductCard.jsx for cases where product.image is missing or fails to load
- [x] Add fallback image handling in medishop-frontend/src/pages/ProductDetails.jsx for cases where product.image is missing or fails to load
- [ ] Verify and potentially update image URLs in medishop-backend/seed/seed.js to ensure they are valid and accessible
- [ ] Test image rendering in the browser after implementing changes
